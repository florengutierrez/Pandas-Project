## Pandas - Project 🐼

In this project I carry out a data cleaning with the help of pandas library and once I have the cleanest dataframe, I launch two hypotheses to work on them.

### 1. Hipothesis:  Sharks pretty much only bite men. 🦈

- I analyze shark attacks between both sexes and how men take most of these attacks.

- Of these attacks I analyze those that cause death or survive.

- I make a short parenthesis visualizing the type of attack that is carried out.

- I inquire into the deaths caused having caused the attack between both sexes.

### 2. Hipothesis: Shark attacks in Spain according to autonomous communities over the years. 🇪🇸

-  From the original dataframe I analyze the country Spain, and group by autonomous      communities.

- I analyze the total shark attacks given in the autonomous communities.

- I group these attacks over the years.
